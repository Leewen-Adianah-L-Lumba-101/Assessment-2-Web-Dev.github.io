                <p style = "max-width: 400px;"> An atmospheric, dimly lit, colour heavy point-and-click styled 8-Bit game. With a dialogue
                    driven story to tell; a harsh reflection of childhood yearning and antique memories. The game is meant as a
                    showcase of escapism and self-inflicted punishment, where a dull unaccomplished adult life can lead one unhealthily 
                    clinging to the warm past.
