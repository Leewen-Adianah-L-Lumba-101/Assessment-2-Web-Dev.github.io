Note: I'd like to add that a video file for 'examples.html' is not present as the uploading file size limit is 25MB which the locally hosted video exceeds in entirety, so it's not a case of code not running correctly but rather the developers own inability to export smaller files.

Note2: The external script file 'javascript.js' is being reused by 'index.html', 'examples.html', and 'contact.html' retrospectively as it reuses the play/mute music function. If there is a error in the debug console, that is related to the functions of 'showSlides()', etc.. not coming to fruition, as it's only in use for the 'examples.html' slideshow function at the top of the page. Both 'index.html' and 'contact.html' do not accomodate the other functions and only the music function.

Note3: The purpose of 'javascript2.js' is to not confuse the slideshow function from 'examples.html' and the slideshow function of 'aboutme.html', as they work similarly in nature but are under different Classes and Ids (or otherwise a more degraded version).
